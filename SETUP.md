# Fitness Tracker Setup

This guide will help you set up your fitness tracker app with Strava and Hevy integrations.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Configure API Keys

Edit `src/config/api.ts` and replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys:

```typescript
export const API_CONFIG = {
  STRAVA: {
    CLIENT_ID: "your_actual_strava_client_id",
    CLIENT_SECRET: "your_actual_strava_client_secret",
    ACCESS_TOKEN: "your_optional_strava_access_token", // Optional - bypasses OAuth
  },
  HEVY: {
    API_KEY: "your_actual_hevy_api_key",
  },
};
```

### 2. Get Your API Keys

**Strava:**

1. Go to [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Click "Create Your Own Application"
3. Fill in the details (any name/description works)
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

**Optional - Strava Direct Access (Easier):**

1. Go to [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Click "View athelte"
3. Copy the access token from the URL (the long string after `access_token=`)
4. Paste it as `ACCESS_TOKEN` in the config

**Hevy:**

1. Open the Hevy app on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
3. Copy your **API Key**

### 3. Run the App

```bash
npm start
npx expo start --tunnel
```

## How It Works

- **Strava**: Two options:
  - **Direct Access** (Recommended): Uses access token directly - no OAuth needed
  - **OAuth Flow**: Traditional authentication - requires one-time setup
- **Hevy**: Uses your API key directly to fetch workout data
- **Calendar**: Shows both running (blue) and gym (orange) activities
- **No UI Complexity**: API keys are stored in config, not entered in the app

## Features

- ðŸ”µ **Blue circles**: Running activities from Strava
- ðŸŸ  **Orange circles**: Gym workouts from Hevy
- ðŸ”µðŸŸ  **Multiple dots**: Days with both activities
- **Month navigation**: Data loads as you browse
- **Connection status**: Shows if services are configured and connected

## Troubleshooting

### Strava Issues

**Direct Access Method:**

- Make sure your access token is correct
- Access tokens don't expire, so this is the easiest method

**OAuth Method:**

- Make sure your Client ID and Secret are correct
- You'll need to authenticate through the OAuth flow once
- Check that your Strava app's callback domain is set to `localhost`

### Hevy Issues

- Verify your API key is correct
- Make sure you have workouts logged in Hevy
- Check your internet connection

### General Issues

- Use tunnel mode for development: `npx expo start --tunnel`
- Check the console for error messages
- Make sure both API keys are properly configured in `src/config/api.ts`

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored in the config file (not in the app UI)
- Strava tokens are stored securely in AsyncStorage (OAuth method only)
- This setup is for personal use - don't commit API keys to public repos

## Next Steps

Once working, you can:

1. Add workout details view when tapping calendar dates
2. Implement statistics and summaries
3. Add more activity types
4. Create custom workout logging
